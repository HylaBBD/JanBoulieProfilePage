            <h2>My infancy</h2>
            <p>
                I was born on 12 December and had 6 siblings. Of course I was the cutest.
                This is why my family picked me! Because of my cute white toes and sleepy eyes (or at least that is what my
                dad tells me).

            <h2>My school</h2>
            <p>
                I went to school for the first time with my dad when I was just 10 weeks old! How smart am I? My dad took me
                every Saturday
                until I graduated puppy school at only 3 months old!
            </p>
            <p>
                After puppy school I went to beginners class and flew through the lessons! After four months, my teacher
                told me I could go
                straight to advanced class with the big dogs! I am now "Advanced-class Boulie" :).
