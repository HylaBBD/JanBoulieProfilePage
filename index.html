                <h2>My infancy</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born on 12 December and had 6 siblings. Of course I was the cutest.
                    This is why my family picked me! Because of my cute white toes and sleepy eyes (or at least that is what my
                    dad tells me).

                <h2>My school</h2>
                <p>
                    I went to school for the first time with my dad when I was just 10 weeks old! How smart am I? My dad took me
                    every Saturday
                    until I graduated puppy school at only 3 months old!
                </p>
                <p>
                    After puppy school I went to beginners class and flew through the lessons! After four months, my teacher
                    told me I could go
                    straight to advanced class with the big dogs! I am now "Advanced-class Boulie" :).
